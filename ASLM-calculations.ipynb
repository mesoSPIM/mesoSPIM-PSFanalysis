    "- $t_{exp}$, pixel exposure time, typically 5-20 ms\n",
    "- $f_{gal}$, galvo scanning frequency, typically 99.99 or 199.9 Hz. Lower is preferred due to heating issues.\n",

    "1. Each pixel is illuminated via galvo sweep one or more times, : $n=1,2,...$, depending on $t_{exp}$ setting.\n",

    "# Notes\n",
    "- exposure higher than `t_exp_max_ms` worsens the axial resolution by using wider-than-optimal LS length (with increasingly widening LS lobes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- exposure smaller than `t_exp_max_ms` uses narrower LS length => somewhat higher z-resolution (10-20%?), but dark vertical stripes may apper due to missing galvo sweeps during a short exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is better to guarantee at least 2 galvo sweeps per pixel (instead of ~1 or less), because non-sufficient sweep coverage creates dark stripes.\n",

    "\n",
    "- 199.9 Hz galvo freq is generally no better than 99.9 Hz in resolution, but allows more galvo sweeps per exposure => better averaging, less striping. 199.9 Hz freq generates a lot of heat at 2X (large amplitude), but tolerable at 5X or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2X has challenging scanning parameters - FOV is large, so the exposure of 10 ms is suboptimal (thicker LS sectioning). However, XY resolution of 2X is 5 um at best, so widening of axial resolution to the same value is OK (isotropic resolution).\n",
